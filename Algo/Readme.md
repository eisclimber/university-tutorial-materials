# Algorithms and Data Structures

This course aimed to teach common algorithms like Dijkstra, Prim, Kruskal, Sorting, Dynamic Programming, ... and data structures like binary trees, quad trees, lists and graphs.
The basic algorithms then had to be optimized, analyzed and applied on more dynamic problems.

Here you will find some slides from my tutorials explaining some problems from the exercises.
Additionally there is a summary searching and sorting as well as code for visualizing and training the O Notation.
