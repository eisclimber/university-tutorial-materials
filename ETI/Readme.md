# Einf√ºhrung in die technische Informatik

ETI started with boolean algebra and it's minimization via raw algebra, KV Diagramms and Quine McCluskey. It continued with the physical, electrical and logical rudiments processors.

Most of the materials in this folder are for the use with (Logisim)[http://www.cburch.com/logisim/], an educational tool for designing and simulating digital logic circuits.
You will find here some example circuits and tutorial on the usage of Logisim.

There is also an example exercise on boolean minimization using KVs and tutorial slides.
