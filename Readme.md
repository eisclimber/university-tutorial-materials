# Tutorial Material

In this repo you will find materials I've created on my own for my tutoring jobs at Uni TÃ¼bingen.  

The materials do not contain any old exercises or any solutions. At most there are some hints, rather specific to the exercises.

Note that many of the files are in german as the courses itself were in german. The courses are:
- Info2: An introduction to Java
- Algo: Various basic algorithms, their usage and performance
- ETI: Introduction to technical Computer Science (boolean logic, electro-physics, ...) 

Make sure you have a look at the README files in the folders for each course.
